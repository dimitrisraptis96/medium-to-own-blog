**VisualEyes** is a next-gen design tool that combines leading neuroscience research with AI to accurately predict how people will react to your digital designs.

### The time is now!

The Beta-testing era has arrived and you’re more than welcome to be a part of it.

![](./asset-2.png)

Currently, we support the three main prototyping tools. **Figma**, **Sketch** and **Adobe XD** plugins have already been developed!

You can request Early Access to the plugins by visiting [our website](https://visualeyes.loceye.io/subscribe)! 🎉

### How it works

It’s simple as that:

**🔌 Input:**

The VisualEyes plugin uploads any kind or size of your design artwork to our platform.

**🧠 Algorithm:**

Our AI algorithm predicts the attention of users based on **_more than 20,000_** eye-tracking data gathered from [our platform](https://www.loceye.io) and open datasets.

**🏆 Output:**

You will receive a transparent (or with the original image as background) heatmap that displays the attention areas of your design.

### Examples

Still feeling confused?! 🤔

It’s time to give you some examples from the real world, that will help you fully understand the usage of our tool.

Below you can find the attention areas of some **popular landing pages** along with the original design:
