To be honest, the yellow banner-strip has attention to its most strong elements, so I can’t recognize the problem with the heatmap there. About the red “Outlet” call to action, maybe it should be included in the hot areas of the heatmap!

However, I understand that your point is other than highlighting some heatmaps inconsistencies! Your primary concern is about the accuracy and efficiency of this new tool.

The thing you miss and probably could clarify your thoughts is that the VisualEyes tool uses an AI model that is trained based on how humans look at the websites for the first seconds of their visits(3'–5'). The dataset is built with some standard demographics and the outcome attention map uses these as reference for the prediction. It can NOT unlock complex customer decision right now. That’s why I emphasize the current drawback of predictive design is the lack of any custom demographic reference.

Anyway, thank you for pointing out your concern as a senior industry UX leader!
