I’m delighted to share some tips about skyrocketing your productivity. Of course, these are my personal ‘hacks’ that may or may not apply to everyone. 

To introduce myself, I’m currently the lead frontend engineer at [Loceye](http://loceye.io) and former visual design freelancer. Moreover, I’m stu**dying** electrical engineering at Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. My passion is design and building open source applications.

These are some of my hobbies, but are enought to make you understand that 24 hours a day are not enough. 

  

Master productivity.

Long story short, I’m an electrical engineering student working as a frontend developer. Occasionally I share UI and/or UX advice as a consultant and used to freelance as graphic designer for years.

Pretty many conflicting hobbies for a 22 years old guy, huh?!

I can still remember myself trying to publish my first Android application 4 years ago. It took me over 4 months to build and publish a dumb unit converting app.

Last month I coded and publish my first npm package in two days.

But, what’s the main difference between the above scenarios? During my journey, I definitely learned how to work and how to manage and organize my time better. Or in other words, I skyrocketed my productivity.

I could talk for hours about small or bigger changes in my daily life or my workflow that affected my productivity. However, I’d like to focus on 3 of them, that really helped my ‘Get Shits Done’ and worked in a surprising way.

1\. Ban your procrastination

2\. Position yourself  
My team used to work at coworking spaces, where networking and opportunities are all the way around. So does the distraction. Finally, we moved to our brand new offices and were so exciting for our new distraction-free space. Everyone was enjoying his time at the office after all. Except me!   
I found myself surfing the internet or losing my focus far too often. Sometimes I could even search manically the facebook feed without any reason at all. I should take measures to do!   
Of course, the solution was as simple as that. I moved my desk!   
What? Why? Where?   
I moved my desk to the most exposed place of our office. The goal was to have my monitor visible from everyone inside the room. It didn’t take more than 1 or 2 days to understand the amazing benefits of my decision. I was more focused than ever to my work. The reason is not other than the fear I felt that everyone always stares at me.   
3.
