First of all, I can totally understand your concerns!

However, this article is **not** about introducing Artificial Intelligence technology to trick people into buying more. My primary intention was to inform people (not only designers or businessmen) about the important contribution of our subconscious behavior and our natural impulse when we visit ta digital user interface. The result can be interpreted in various ways! From a typical business owner in order to trick users and increase the conversion rates. From a typical user in order to prevent being a victim next time he enters an online or physical store.

Lastly, I strongly disagree that nowadays women are the primary advertising target. Just a visit to the ASOS.com (or any other store) online store can persuade you that product equally target both women and men. Personally, I was an advertising victim numerous times in my life!

Anyway, thank you very much for your comment because you helped me clarify my position!
