Unfortunately, no one contacted me to approve or disprove this research. It would be interesting to compare my result with a real A/B test.

Moreover, here is a document about the VisualEyes’ accuracy: [bit.ly/2NFa8i6](https://t.co/LJylWm8yat?amp=1 "http://bit.ly/2NFa8i6")  
It demonstrates the correlation between real eye-tracking data and the VisualEyes’ prediction.
