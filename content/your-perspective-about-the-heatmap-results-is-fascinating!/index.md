Your perspective about the heatmap results is fascinating! It’s another great interpretation of the user’s time allocation!

Your point about the difference between looking and taking action is highly respected and accurate. I never tried to replace the UX process or underestimate its importance but my intention here is to introduce a new pre-testing method that can accelerate the design process. The attention map cannot guarantee that the customer will click and buy the product, but can help the designer have a basic view of the total attention allocation. These insights can guide the designer to create attention driven work with equally distributed attention. My “winner” is not based on the highest product attention because this is obviously not good practice. I aimed at the “better” attention distribution and flow.
